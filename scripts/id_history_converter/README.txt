Summary
=======

This is a program that takes a file with a list of stable IDs (for genes, 
transcripts and/or translations), and outputs a comma-separated list of 
the history of  each of these stable IDs. The history ends with either 
the current release or at the point when the stable ID was retired.


Documentation
=============

For a summary of command line flags, run:

perl IDmapper.pl --help

  IDmapper.pl --species=species [ --file=filename ]

  IDmapper.pl --help


    --species / -s  Name of species.

    --file    / -f  (Optional) Name of file containing a list of stable
                    IDs.  The default is to read the list from standard
