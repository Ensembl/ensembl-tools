# This is a program that takes a file with a list of stable IDs (not
# exon stable IDs), and outputs a comma-separated list of the history of
# each of these stable IDs.  The history ends with either the current
# release or at the point when the stable ID was retired.

Usage:
  $0 --species=species [ --file=filename ]

  $0 --help


    --species / -s  Name of species.

    --file    / -f  (Optional) Name of file containing a list of stable
                    IDs.  The default is to read the list from standard
                    input.

    --help    / -h  To see this text.

Example usage:

  $0 -s mouse -f idlist.txt

  # Same as the above:
  $0 -s mouse < idlist.txt

  sort -u longlist.txt | $0 -s human
